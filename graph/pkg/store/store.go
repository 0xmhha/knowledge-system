// Package store is the public, read-only graph access surface for external
// callers (eval harness, sister repos like code-knowledge-system). It
// re-exports the minimum useful subset of internal/persist as type aliases
// so callers don't have to depend on internal/persist directly. Write
// access stays internal — there is no Writer here by design.
//
// # Stability
//
// This surface follows semantic versioning once the sister-repo extraction
// lands. Until then, treat it as the single throat to choke when changing
// internal/persist — anything that breaks the alias here will break
// external consumers, even if in-repo callers compile fine.
//
// # What to import from where
//
// External consumers (anything outside this module) should import only
// from pkg/store and pkg/types. They cannot reach internal/persist by
// the Go `internal/` rule, and that's intentional: pkg/store decides what
// to promote to the public surface.
//
// Reader covers the read API; SearchHit / SearchFTSOptions /
// FindSymbolOptions are the value types you'll touch when calling
// Reader.SearchFTS or Reader.FindSymbol. Manifest is the minimal
// mirror of build-time metadata — use the GetManifest helper rather
// than Reader.GetManifest directly so the projection (which drops
// incremental-cache fields) stays the single source of truth (CKG-7).
//
// # Do NOT
//
// External code MUST NOT type-alias persist.StoreReader on its own
// (the "self-shim" pattern surfaced by the cks dogfood). That duplicates
// the public surface and silently drifts the moment we change
// internal/persist. If you find yourself wanting one, it means a type
// you need isn't re-exported here yet — open a PR to add the alias
// instead.
