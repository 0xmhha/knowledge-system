// Package stage3 implements the composer pipeline's Stage 3: expand the
// citations from Stage 2 with their graph neighbors via ckg.Neighbors,
// adding caller/callee/imports/etc. context that Stage 2 (BM25 + Symbol)
// cannot reach on its own.
//
// Strategy:
//
//  1. Take Stage 2 citations and pass them through as Seeds (B.6 budget
//     and B.8 wire-up see the full Stage 2 work).
//  2. Expand only the top N seeds by score (default 10). Lower-ranked
//     seeds are weak signals — expanding them mostly amplifies noise.
//  3. For each expanded seed, call ckg.Neighbors with an Intent-specific
//     Relation set and Hop depth.
//  4. Aggregate by Target citation: dedup, taking the MAX score across
//     multiple paths (closest-path evidence wins). Skip neighbors that
//     are already in the Seed set — we don't double-count.
//  5. Cap and rank for downstream consumption.
//
// Intent influence at this stage is the strongest in the pipeline:
// "BugFix" wants caller chains; "ArchExplain" wants imports/implements/
// embeds; "TestAdd" wants tested_by. See intent_relations.go for the
// full mapping. Stage 3 deliberately leans on Intent because graph
// traversal is the place where "which structural relationships matter"
// differs most across user intents.
