# go-stablenet — Domain Knowledge Inventory

Project: `go-stablenet`
Schema version: 1
Code root: resolved at runtime from `$CKS_CODE_ROOT` (override) or `$GO_STABLENET_ROOT` — see `project.yaml`; no machine path is committed.
Verification baseline: go-stablenet `@9978930ba` (dev — WBFT justification fix #84).

## Conventions

- All entries follow `shared/SCHEMA.md`.
- Status transitions follow `shared/STATUS_LIFECYCLE.md`.
- Knowledge types follow `shared/KNOWLEDGE_TYPES.md`.

## Pending work

All 14 subsystems (A1–A14) and every knowledge type (B1–B7) are
covered. The inventory is in the reviewer-verification phase — moving
entries from `needs_verification` to `verified` is what lets `ckv build`
pick them up. **3 entries currently sit at `needs_verification`** and do
not yet ship to the index:

- `A1.testing.consensus_change_validation` (B6, P0)
- `A4.gov_validator.storage_and_governance` (B2, P0)
- `A11.txpool.type_taxonomy_admission` (B1, P0)

Remaining candidates worth adding once the current backlog is verified:

- A4: per-contract entry for GovCouncil (GovMasterMinter is now covered by `A4.gov_minter.mint_proposal_allowance`)
- A11: mempool ordering with AnzeonTipEnv (B3), fee-delegation (0x16) signing path
- A2: WBFTExtra round-trip examples (B5)
- A9: istanbul peer handshake details (B3)
