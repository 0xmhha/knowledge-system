**Title**: WBFT Core lock discipline — never read Core.current off currentMutex
**Source of truth**: `code` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 7** (concurrency (Core.current off mutex, txpool mutation))

**Summary** (read first):

> The WBFT Core's `current` round-state pointer is guarded by
> `currentMutex` (consensus/wbft/core/core.go:106 — a sync.RWMutex).
> Every accessor that reads `c.current` MUST hold currentMutex.RLock
> (read) or currentMutex.Lock (write). Examples in-repo: the
> current-proposal accessor at core.go:155-157 acquires RLock around
> the read; the round-state mutator at core.go:162-166 acquires
> Lock for the entire write region.
> 
> The priorState struct (core.go:72) embeds its own sync.RWMutex —
> this is a SEPARATE lock, NOT a substitute. Reading `c.current.X`
> while holding only priorState's lock (or no lock) is a data race
> against round-change writers and produces non-deterministic
> consensus outcomes (e.g. accepting a Prepare for a stale round).
> 
> The trap: an LLM adding telemetry, a new RPC, or a fast-path early
> return that touches `c.current` outside the locked region. The
> race is subtle — tests pass under low contention — but under real
> network load it shows up as occasional fork or stall. Any new
> read of `c.current` (or its sub-fields like Sequence/Round/
> pendingRequest) MUST be inside currentMutex's read region; any
> write MUST be inside the write region.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `consensus/wbft/core/core.go:106` · `Core.currentMutex` — Round-state RWMutex — guards every access to c.current
2. `consensus/wbft/core/core.go:155` — Example read region: RLock → read c.current → RUnlock
3. `consensus/wbft/core/core.go:162` — Example write region: Lock → mutate c.current → Unlock
4. `consensus/wbft/core/core.go:72` · `priorState` — priorState carries its own RWMutex — separate from currentMutex, NOT a substitute

**Title**: WBFT consensus flow — actors and message sequence per height
**Source of truth**: `code+docs` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 1** (stake-weighted voting / slashing)

**Summary** (read first):

> The WBFT consensus engine drives one block per height through four
> phases inside Core: handleRequest emits a Preprepare from the
> current proposer; every validator broadcasts a Prepare in response;
> once each validator has seen a Prepare quorum it broadcasts a Commit;
> once each validator has seen a Commit quorum the block is finalised
> and Core advances to the next height via startNewRound. RoundChange
> fires on RequestTimeout and selects a new proposer for the same
> height. Backend (consensus/wbft/backend) is the bridge between Core
> and the blockchain — it broadcasts/gossips messages, signs with BLS,
> fetches Validators, and commits sealed blocks back. Engine
> (consensus/wbft/engine) handles header validation, BaseFee
> distribution, and epoch construction. The Istanbul/100 P2P
> subprotocol (A9) carries the messages between nodes.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `consensus/wbft/core/core.go:167` · `Core.startNewRound` — entry point for each new round/sequence — orchestrates state transitions
2. `consensus/wbft/core/handler.go` — event loop, message routing into handle{Preprepare,Prepare,Commit,RoundChange}Msg
3. `consensus/wbft/core/preprepare.go` — Preprepare generation/validation
4. `consensus/wbft/core/prepare.go` — Prepare validation + quorum check that drives StatePrepared
5. `consensus/wbft/core/commit.go` — Commit validation + quorum check that drives StateCommitted
6. `consensus/wbft/core/roundchange.go` — RoundChange protocol on RequestTimeout
7. `consensus/wbft/backend/backend.go` — Backend interface implementation — blockchain ↔ Core bridge
8. `consensus/wbft/backend/engine.go` — epoch build, validator lookup, BLS signing
9. `consensus/wbft/engine/engine.go` — header verification, processFinalize where system-contract upgrades land

### `A1.wbft_core.quorum_calc` · `[P0 · A1 · B3 · risk:high]` · ✅ **APPROVED 2026-06-07 by mhha**

**Title**: WBFT quorum size calculation
**Source of truth**: `code+docs` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 4** (quorum reimplementation (ceil(N−F) split-brain))

**Summary** (read first):

> WBFT requires QuorumSize = ceil(N - F) where N is the validator set
> size and F = (N-1)/3 evaluated in float64. The quorum is the minimum
> count of Prepare or Commit messages needed before the consensus core
> advances state. State advancement in handlePrepareMsg uses the
> expression WBFTPrepares.Size() >= valSet.QuorumSize().
> 
> ceil(N - F) is the AUTHORITATIVE quorum; any reimplementation MUST
> reproduce it exactly. The dangerous refactor is not int-vs-float (see
> the correctness note below) but swapping the FORMULA: the PBFT-textbook
> 2f+1 or a simple majority N/2+1 DIVERGE from ceil(N - F) for N not of
> the form 3f+1, and a lower quorum finalizes with too few honest nodes
> (a safety violation). Examples: N=5 -> ceil=4 but 2f+1=3; N=6 -> ceil=5
> but 2f+1=3; N=8 -> ceil=6 but 2f+1=5.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `consensus/wbft/validator/default.go:226` · `defaultSet.F` — F = (N-1)/3 as float64 — integer cast would lose precision
2. `consensus/wbft/validator/default.go:230` · `defaultSet.QuorumSize` — QuorumSize = ceil(N - F) using math.Ceil over float64
3. `consensus/wbft/core/prepare.go:87` · `Core.handlePrepareMsg` — threshold check that gates StatePrepared transition
4. `consensus/wbft/types.go:216` · `ValidatorSet` — interface declaration; F() returns float64 (not int)

**Summary** (read first):

> WBFT recovers from a stuck round (PRE-PREPARE or COMMIT quorum not

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `consensus/wbft/core/roundchange.go:40` · `Core.broadcastNextRoundChange` — entry point fired on RequestTimeout; increments round and broadcasts a signed ROUND-CHANGE
2. `consensus/wbft/core/roundchange.go:52` · `Core.broadcastRoundChange` — builds and signs ROUND-CHANGE for a target round, attaches prepared-block justification
3. `consensus/wbft/core/roundchange.go:103` · `Core.handleRoundChangeMsg` — validates and accumulates incoming ROUND-CHANGE messages, triggers view change at quorum
4. `consensus/wbft/messages/roundchange.go:37` · `RoundChange` — message struct: Sequence, Round, PreparedRound, PreparedBlock
5. `consensus/wbft/messages/roundchange.go:64` · `SignedRoundChangePayload` — signed payload, encodePayloadInternal defines the digest used for signing

**Title**: WBFT BLS seal scheme — 96-byte aggregate + SealerSet bitpack
**Source of truth**: `code` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 3** (ETH-denominated assumptions (WKRC, base-fee redistribution))

**Summary** (read first):

> WBFT consensus seals are BLS aggregate signatures. The data structure
> is WBFTAggregatedSeal (core/types/istanbul.go:52) carrying a
> SealerSet bitpack (which validators signed, by ordered index) plus
> the aggregate 96-byte BLS signature. Two such seals live in
> WBFTExtra (core/types/istanbul.go:81): PrevPreparedSeal and
> PrevCommittedSeal, the latter being the previous block's commit
> attestation. BLS primitives are in crypto/bls/.
> 
> The trap: an LLM editing seal encoding, hashing, or verification
> often assumes Ethereum's secp256k1 ECDSA signatures (65 bytes,
> recoverable v/r/s) and mis-sizes buffers, mis-computes hashes (using
> Keccak over the wrong payload), or attempts ecrecover on a BLS
> signature. The SealerSet bitpack also encodes WHO signed; dropping
> or reordering bits changes the attested validator set without
> changing the signature, which a naive verifier will accept. Any
> change to extra-data, seal serialization, or filtered-header hashing
> MUST preserve the WBFTAggregatedSeal byte layout exactly.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

**Source of truth**: `code` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 7** (concurrency (Core.current off mutex, txpool mutation))

**Summary** (read first):

> The legacy txpool runs a single goroutine — `pool.loop()` (started at

> The sealer (miner/) and the txpool reorg loop interact across this
> boundary: when the sealer requests a payload, it observes the
> txpool's state at a point AFTER a reorg-run; mutating txpool maps
> directly from the sealer (or from a tx-submission handler) WITHOUT
> going through the loop is a data race that can either lose pending
> txs or double-include them.

> The trap: an LLM adding a "fast path" that mutates pool.pending /

> intermittent: tx drops, double-spend rejection on a tx that was
> validly removed, occasional miner crash on map iteration. Any new
> txpool mutation MUST enqueue into the loop's channel, not call the
> map mutators directly.

**Title**: Block hash computation requires WBFTFilteredHeader first
**Source of truth**: `code+docs` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 5** (feepayer sigHash payload)

**Summary** (read first):

> WBFT block hashing has a non-obvious requirement: before computing a
> block hash you must strip the round number and the PreparedSeal /
> CommittedSeal from the header's WBFTExtra, because those fields are
> filled in by the consensus layer after the header is created and
> therefore differ between proposer and recipient. WBFTFilteredHeader
> returns a copy of the header with Round set to 0 and Seal fields
> cleared; WBFTFilteredHeaderWithRound does the same but preserves a
> caller-supplied round. Hashing the raw header instead of the filtered
> one produces a hash nobody else can reproduce, breaking signature
> verification and block lookup.

### `A8.genesis.bootstrap_architecture` · `[P0 · A8 · B1 · risk:low]` · ✅ **APPROVED 2026-06-07 by mhha**

**Title**: Genesis bootstrap architecture: from JSON to first block on disk
**Source of truth**: `code+docs` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 1** (stake-weighted voting / slashing)

**Summary** (read first):

> Node startup with an empty DB takes a Genesis struct (parsed from
> embedded JSON for Mainnet/Testnet) through three sequential stages:
> (1) validateAnzeonGenesisConfig enforces that the Anzeon section is
> well-formed; (2) initializeAnzeonGenesis builds the initial block
> Extra (vanity + initial validator set + initial BLS keys) and calls
> InjectContracts which deploys every system contract listed in
> config.Anzeon.SystemContracts plus any block-0 hardfork overlays
> collected from CollectUpgrades; (3) genesis.ToBlock writes the
> resulting Alloc to the state DB, computes the state root, and
> embeds it in the block header; finally genesis.Commit flushes the
> trie to disk. The genesis_generator CLI uses the same path with
> user-supplied parameters and serialises the result to JSON for
> bootstrapping a new network.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `core/genesis.go:282` · `SetupGenesisBlockWithOverride` — top-level entry point invoked by node init
2. `core/genesis.go:231` · `validateAnzeonGenesisConfig` — stage 1 — schema/shape validation
3. `core/genesis.go:242` · `initializeAnzeonGenesis` — stage 2 — initial Extra + InjectContracts
4. `core/genesis.go:510` · `Genesis.ToBlock` — stage 3a — Alloc → stateDB, computes state root
5. `core/genesis.go:575` · `Genesis.Commit` — stage 3b — flush state trie to disk
6. `core/genesis.go:735` · `InjectContracts` — deploys the 5 system contracts + applies any block-0 hardfork overlays
7. `core/genesis.go:617` · `DefaultStableNetMainnetGenesisBlock` — embedded Mainnet/Testnet genesis builders (also DefaultStableNetTestnetGenesisBlock); consumed by cmd/utils/flags.go to bootstrap a node with the canonical chain
8. `cmd/genesis_generator/` — CLI that generates a fresh network's genesis JSON

**Title**: Genesis JSON authoring checklist for stablenet chains
**Source of truth**: `code` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 1** (stake-weighted voting / slashing)

**Summary** (read first):

> validateAnzeonGenesisConfig is the gate every stablenet genesis JSON
> passes through before initializeAnzeonGenesis materialises the
> block-zero state. The authoring checklist captures every section the
> validator requires: ChainConfig with the Anzeon hardfork block, WBFT
> consensus parameters, the Init section (validators plus matching BLS
> keys), the SystemContracts section selecting versions for each of
> the five governance contracts, and per-account Extra bits that must
> satisfy ValidateExtra. cmd/genesis_generator provides an interactive
> tool for filling these in.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `core/genesis.go:231` · `validateAnzeonGenesisConfig` — the gate; calls ChainConfig.Anzeon.CheckValidity on every required section
2. `core/genesis.go:242` · `initializeAnzeonGenesis` — after validate succeeds, sets up WBFT extra data and calls InjectContracts
3. `cmd/genesis_generator/genesis_generator.go` — interactive CLI that produces a valid genesis JSON skeleton

### `A9.istanbul_p2p.protocol_architecture` · `[P1 · A9 · B1 · risk:low]` · ✅ **APPROVED 2026-06-07 by mhha**

**Title**: istanbul/100 subprotocol architecture: piggy-backed on eth peers
**Source of truth**: `code+docs` · **Status**: `needs_verification`
**Maps to**: **07 §9 item 3** (ETH-denominated assumptions (WKRC, base-fee redistribution))

**Summary** (read first):

> WBFT consensus messages travel over a dedicated P2P subprotocol
> named istanbul, version 100, registered alongside the standard
> eth protocol. The 22-message subprotocol does not create its own
> peer set — every istanbul peer is an existing eth Peer whose
> EthPeerRegistered channel signals when it is ready to carry
> consensus traffic. When an istanbul message arrives, the handler
> dispatches it into the consensus engine's HandleMsg, which routes
> it to Core.handleEvents. Messages exceeding protocolMaxMsgSize
> are rejected before any consensus parsing. wbft.ErrStoppedEngine
> during peer-receive while the eth downloader is synchronising is
> expected and downgraded to debug-level logging — the engine starts
> consuming messages only after sync completes.

**Anchors** (mechanical ✅ — already file+line+symbol consistent):

1. `eth/quorum_protocol.go:39` · `Istanbul100` — protocol version constant
2. `eth/quorum_protocol.go:41` · `quorumConsensusProtocolName` — protocol name literal — "istanbul"
3. `eth/quorum_protocol.go:54` · `quorumConsensusProtocolLengths` — 22 messages on Istanbul100
4. `eth/handler_istanbul.go:82` · `EthPeerRegistered` — eth-peer-ready signal — istanbul reuses eth peers, never creates its own
5. `eth/handler_istanbul.go:138` · `protocolMaxMsgSize` — message size gate — rejection happens before consensus parsing
6. `eth/handler_istanbul.go:120` · `wbft.ErrStoppedEngine` — sync-time error path — debug log only, not warn/error
7. `consensus/wbft/backend/handler.go` — HandleMsg implementation that bridges P2P to consensus Core

## Notes on generator behaviour

- The `Maps to:` line uses a token-overlap heuristic against the 07 §9 catalog. If the suggested item is wrong, the reviewer should correct it in-line — the worksheet is treated as a working document, not as authoritative metadata.
- The `suggested: …` hint on each invariant is the anchor whose `reason` field shares the most words with the invariant text. A hint is shown only when at least one anchor scores > 0; otherwise the slot is left blank.
- B6 entries (`procedure_steps`) and B7 entries (`constants`) get extra question blocks (Q5/Q6); other knowledge types omit them.
