// HitSource identifies which backend produced (or, after fusion, dominated)
// a Hit. The composer attaches this so downstream consumers (evaluation
// metrics, audit log) can attribute results back to ckg vs ckv vs the
// fused output.

// Hit is one search result with its post-fusion ranking and score.
//
// Rank is 1-based and reflects position in the fused list (or in the
// originating backend's list when Source is not "fused"). Score is the
// composer's fused score — for RRF fusion this is the sum of reciprocal
// ranks, not directly comparable to backend-native scores (BM25, cosine).
// For backend-attributed hits (Source = ckg or ckv) Score is the
// backend's native score passed through unchanged.
//
// Hits do not carry the matched code body; that lives in EvidencePack.Bodies
// keyed by Citation, so a single body can serve many hits.
//
// Symbol and CanonicalID are populated only for HitSourceCKV hits when the
// underlying ckv chunk carries them. They are the bridge to ckg: composer
// Stage 1 extracts Symbol (not just the file basename) as a candidate keyword
// for Stage 2's ckg fan-out; CanonicalID is ckg's import-path-qualified symbol
// id (ADR-0001) inherited by the chunk — the build-stable, single join key that
// resolves via ckg FindByCanonicalID / the canonical-first FindSymbol path.
// (The former positional ckg_node_id was retired once canonical_id became the
// sole join key — ADR-0001; ckv no longer carries it.)
// Both are omitempty for backward compatibility with hits that pre-date the
// alignment work.
